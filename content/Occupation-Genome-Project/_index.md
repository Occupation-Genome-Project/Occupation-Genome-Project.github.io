Through works expanding for more than a decade, our research team has used a variety of genetic methods, including twins and candidate genes to study genetic foundation of job attainment and leadership. More recently, in behavioural research domains, investigations using the genome wide association (GWAS) approach have generated evidence in terms of genome wide variants that are related to important psychosocial variables such as IQ, education, and neuroticism. Our research group aims to bring the GWAS approach into management research by leveraging on the existing UK Biobank, Add Health, WLS, HRS and other genomic data sets.

The essential questions our team intend to address include: 1), what are genomic loci that are significantly associated with occupational attainment, such as job complexity, autonomy, and leadership positions? 2), how personal traits, such as IQ, personality, and risk taking, are genetically associated with occupational attainment? 3), how occupational attainment is genetically associated with a variety of indices of well-being, such as subjective well-being, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, BMI, and health behaviors?
